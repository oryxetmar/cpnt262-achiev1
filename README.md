## Pluggin' Away - Achiev 1

I installed Chart.js by downloading https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/chart.js and pulling the chart.js file from the Dist folder.
I moved 'chart.js" into a new folder titled "cpnt262-achiev1" and created a new index file to put my html in.
I put the appropriate script into the `head` of my html file :
 `<script src="path/to/chartjs/dist/chart.js"></script>
<script>
    const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {...});
</script>
And then continued to follow instruction for integration and the attached bar chart example. 

## I donwloaded npm and used external `script` in the head of my hmtl file to play around with practice charts for this assignment

## Code-Journal Style Assesment:

- I struggled to understand the difference between npm and cdn

- i realized after seeing this quick online question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43605215/using-cdn-vs-installing-library-by-npm
    - that i should have used the cdn link , and likely would not have need to download nearly as many files/folders to host it all locally. 

(i think)


- a link I used : https://www.javatpoint.com/how-to-call-javascript-function-in-html
- Hyeju was an awesome lab partner and seemed to be struggling with a similar issue. It was nice to be able to check in with what was working and what wasnt working for her. 
- My main issue was editing the way i was trying to link my html file to my .js file 
    - I am finally understanding how to map paths from file to file (i had the path incorrect which was why my chart would not open in live pages)

I am spending the rest of my evening trying ot further understand the differences and building my own charts without so heavily relying on an exmaple.
